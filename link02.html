六祖慧能《六祖坛经》: shadow of shadows  <br><br>

因为其师兄神秀的偈：身似菩提树，心似明镜台，时时勤拂拭，勿使惹尘埃 。六祖感觉禅悟不彻底，于是吟出了：菩提本无树,明镜亦非台,本来无一物,何处惹尘埃 。 <br><br>

House Majority Whip，好像东德的Mielke，疏通下水道。<br><br>

Party leaders and whips of the United States House of Representatives are elected by their respective parties in a closed-door caucus by secret ballot and are also known as floor leaders. The U.S. House of Representatives does not officially use the term "Minority Leader" although the media frequently do. The House instead uses the terms "Republican Leader" or "Democratic Leader" depending on which party holds a minority of seats.<br><br>

The current House Majority Leader is Republican Eric Cantor, while the current House Minority Leader is Democrat Nancy Pelosi.<br><br>

The current House Majority Whip is Republican Kevin McCarthy, while the current House Minority Whip is Democrat Steny Hoyer.

Karl Christian Rove (1950) is an American Republican political consultant and policy advisor. He was Senior Advisor and Deputy Chief of Staff during the George W. Bush administration until Rove's resignation on August 31, 2007. He has also headed the Office of Political Affairs, the Office of Public Liaison, and the White House Office of Strategic Initiatives.

Christopher Lu (卢沛宁, 1966) served as Assistant to the President and Cabinet Secretary for President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2013. Lu graduated from the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University and from Harvard Law School, a classmate of Obama's (alumni).<br><br>

In 2005, Lu first began working for Barack Obama in his U.S. Senate office, where Lu served as legislative director and acting chief of staff. Following Obama's successful 2008 campaign for presidency, Lu was appointed executive director of the Obama-Biden Transition Project. When Obama appointed Lu as Cabinet Secretary, The New York Times described him as "one of the highest-ranking Asian Americans in the Obama administration". <br><br>

##如此说来，《House of Cards》体现了我们的领导不但没有品味，而且缺乏见识。几年前，下届常委曾推荐新书《论语别裁》。果真文革组无人可用也？我不知道...##<br><br>

EXT. UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - NIGHT<br><br>
SLOWLY PULL IN on the front door of a fashionable DC townhouse.<br><br>
Off-screen, we hear the SOUND OF SCREECHING TIRES followed by a LOUD COLLISION. A CAR ALARM blares.<br><br>
After a moment, the door to the townhouse opens and A MAN emerges, curious to see what the commotion is outside.<br><br>
As the Man comes into the light we see he’s dressed in a crisp TUXEDO with the collar unfastened, no tie. This is FRANCIS UNDERWOOD - Richard III, Iago and Hannibal Lecter all rolled into one. He has intelligent eyes, mischievous lips and a deep baritone dripping with Southern charm.<br><br>
Francis glances down the street. He see a CAR backing up then PEELING AWAY from the parked car that it just hit. It disappears around the block.<br><br>
As Francis heads purposefully toward the scene of the accident, we begin to hear a DOG WHIMPERING IN PAIN. Francis looks down at the ground. Francis’ security detail guy STEVE (40s) appears beside him. <br><br>
FRANCIS<br><br>
Did you get a good look?<br><br>
STEVE<br><br>
Blue Toyota Camry. First two letters of the plate.<br><br>
Francis and Steve gaze down at the suffering animal.<br><br>
FRANCIS<br><br>
The Warton’s dog.<br><br>
STEVE<br><br>
Looks like a broken back.<br><br>
FRANCIS<br><br>
It’s not gonna make it.<br><br>
(to Steve)<br><br>
Go next door and see if they’re home.<br><br>
Steve heads towards the neighbors’ townhouse.<br><br>
Francis kneels down beside the dog. It’s in awful shape. He tenderly strokes the dog’s head.<br><br>
FRANCIS (CONT’D)<br><br>
Shhhh. It’s okay...<br><br>
Francis looks up at us. The sound of CAR ALARM FADES. <br><br>
FRANCIS (CONT’D) (to the camera)<br><br>
There are two kinds of pain. Good pain - the sort of pain that motivates, that makes you strong. Then there’s bad pain C useless pain, the sort of pain that’s only suffering. I welcome the former. I have no patience for the latter.<br><br>
With cool-headed deliberateness, Francis calmly places a hand around the dog’s neck and begins to put it out of its misery.<br><br>
FRANCIS (CONT’D) (to the camera)<br><br>
Moments like this require someone like me. Someone who will act. Who will do what no one else has the courage to do. The unpleasant thing. The necessary thing.<br><br>
The Dog’s muffled whimpers cease. Francis looks down.<br><br>
FRANCIS (CONT’D) (to the dog)<br><br>
There. No more pain.<br><br>
He lets go. The sound of the CAR ALARM RISES again.<br><br>
Francis stands as Steve approaches. The shook-up neighbors, JACK and BARBARA WARTON, follow several yards behind.<br><br>
FRANCIS (CONT’D) (aside, to Steve)<br><br>
We need to leave in ten minutes.<br><br>
STEVE<br><br>
Car’s ready.<br><br>
Francis turns his attention to the couple. He gently approaches them with endless sympathy in his eyes.<br><br>
FRANCIS<br><br>
It was a hit and run.<br><br>
JACK (to his wife)<br><br>
He must’ve jumped over the gate again...<br><br>
Barbara wells up. Francis lays a hand on her shoulder.<br><br>
FRANCIS<br><br>
I’m so sorry. I’ll have Steve file a report. We’ll track them down.<br><br>
INT. UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER<br><br>
Francis stands at his sink, methodically washing his hands.<br><br>
INT. UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER<br><br>
CLOSE ON FRANCIS’ HANDS zipping up the back of a woman’s elegant evening gown.<br><br>
We PULL BACK to see that the gown belongs to Francis’ wife -CLAIRE UNDERWOOD. She’s the epitome of elegance and poise.
FRANCIS(taking her in)<br><br>
Stunning.<br><br>
CLAIRE(straightening his tie)<br><br>
You too.<br><br>
Francis looks composed, dignified. If we hadn’t known, we never would have guessed what he was up to just moments before. He offers his arm to Claire.<br><br>
FRANCIS<br><br>
Ready?<br><br>
INT. GRAND BALLROOM - SECONDS UNTIL MIDNIGHT<br><br>
A loud, raucous count-down. DC's Democratic Party elite are watching the Times Square ball drop on massive monitors.<br><br>
Three! Two! One! Noisemakers. Applause. People kiss and hug. The sound fades as one face in the crowd, Francis, turns to the camera.<br><br>
We PAN to the stage to reveal a beaming GARRETT WALKER (late 40s), the apotheosis of leadership. He’s flanked by his family - wife PATRICIA and two teenage sons. They lead the crowd in “Auld Lang Syne.”<br><br>
FRANCIS (V.O.)<br><br>
President-Elect Garrett Walker. I might not like him, I might not believe in him, but it doesn’t matter...<br><br>
The camera finds Francis in the adoring crowd.<br><br>
FRANCIS (staring up at Walker)<br><br>
Anyone who can get 70 million Americans to vote for him deserves my respect.<br><br>
(to the camera)<br><br>
I helped get him elected. After twenty-five years in Congress I can tell which way the wind is blowing.<br><br>
We CUT TO to Walker’s soon-to-be V.P. JIM MATTHEWS (early 60s) and his large gaggle of a family.<br><br>
FRANCIS (V.O.)<br><br>
Jim Matthews - his Vice President. Former Governor of Pennsylvania. He did his duty delivering the Keystone State. Now they’ll put him pasture. He has four years of obscurity and impotence ahead of him.<br><br>
CUT TO Walker’s recently appointed Chief of Staff LINDA VASQUEZ. She’s in the back of the ballroom, being prepped with make-up for a TV stand-up interview.<br><br>
FRANCIS (V.O.)<br><br>
Linda Vasquez - Walker’s Chief of Staff. I like her even less than Walker, but she’s the gate keeper to the White House. If you don’t want to be left standing out in the cold, you can’t ignore the person holding the keys.<br><br>
The lights from the TV cam flip on, bathing her face in a bright glow. She instantly flashes a toothy smile.<br><br>
We CUT BACK TO Francis standing in the crowd, his arm around Claire’s waist. She’s singing along with the crowd.<br><br>
FRANCIS<br><br>
As for me - I’m the House Majority Whip. In other words - I get things done. When it comes to legislation I make the magic happen. I transform the impossible into the probable.<br><br>
We ZOOM IN SLOWLY on Francis.<br><br>
FRANCIS (CONT’D)<br><br>
But it’s time to move up a rung上移一级. I’ve paid my dues 应交款. I’ve backed the right man. And now that he’s won I’ll get my just reward. Give and take, give and take, and so the world spins.<br><br>
TIGHT on Francis’ face, filling the frame.<br><br>
FRANCIS (CONT’D)<br><br>
Welcome to Washington.<br><br>

The episode opens with U.S. Representative Francis "Frank" J. Underwood (Kevin Spacey) exiting his house after hearing a crash and animal noises, to find his neighbour's dog lying in the road, whimpering in agony, and the vehicle that hit it speeding away. While his driver, who also witnessed the incident, goes to get the neighbours who own the dog, Frank gently shushes the dog, noting that it will not survive its injuries. Deciding to end its suffering, Frank calmly proceeds to strangle the dog. Much of Underwood's dialogue throughout the episode is presented in a direct address to the audience, a narrative technique that breaks the fourth wall.<br><br>

Underwood, an ambitious Democratic congressman and the House Majority Whip, then finishes getting ready to attend a Gala celebrating the victory of Garrett Walker (Michael Gill), upon his election as President of the United States. He was a vital ally during Walker's campaign, and was promised the position of Secretary of State in return. However, before Walker is sworn in, Chief of Staff Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey) announces that the president will not honor the agreement and will instead nominate Senator Michael Kern (Kevin Kilner), relegating Underwood to tasks such as helping guide new legislation through Congress in support of the agenda in the first 100 days. Furious at Walker's betrayal, Underwood and his wife Claire (Robin Wright), an environmental activist, make a pact to destroy Kern. Underwood, with the assistance of his Chief of Staff, Doug Stamper, (Michael Kelly) begins seeking out pawns in his war against Walker. Underwood also encounters Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara), a young, opportunistic political reporter for the Washington Herald newspaper. Without understanding what she is getting into, Barnes uses her fortunate appearance in a photo with Underwood as an entre to make his acquaintance. When the troubled Rep. Peter Russo (Corey Stoll) is arrested for drunk driving, Underwood offers him a reprieve in exchange for his loyalty. Eventually Underwood and Barnes come to an agreement where Underwood will give Barnes inside information.<br><br>

2010年2月，William D. Cohen写了一本书，名字就是《House of Cards》,讲的是华尔街次债危机。老实说，最初我以为今年热映的电视剧《House of Cards》，就是根据我看的这本书改编的，当时心里还犯嘀咕，衍生证券、兼并收购那么枯燥的玩意能拍得好，好到“万人空巷”的程度？结果证明我的猜测是错的。美国的这部同名电视剧，不是根据Cohen的书改编的，而是根据1990年英国同名的电视剧改编的，而英国的电视剧又是根据1989年Michael Dobbs同名畅销小说改编的。<br><br>


用扑克牌搭房子是个由来已久的游戏，屡屡有人尝试纸牌用量的吉尼斯纪录。最新的纪录是个美国人在2010年3月12日创造的，他用了21万张扑克牌搭了澳门威尼斯人酒店。 <br><br>
House of cards字面意义是纸牌搭成的房子，用来比喻任何基础不牢固的事物，人类历史上诸如此类的“海市蜃楼”的事真不少，用其了形容恰如其分，难怪很多作家格外青睐这句习语。看来古今中外一个样，有个好名字很重要。 好名字沾光。<br><br>


如果说作者喜欢好名字，观众则喜欢好故事，而讲宫斗的故事甚至比喜剧、悲剧更容易成为男女老少都喜欢的好故事，这也是天涯共此情，古今中外概莫能外。美国的这部电视剧就是宫斗片，虽然它直接改编自英国的那部迷你剧，但就是在美国，它也有祖宗，比如1999年的《白宫风云》（The West Wing），也有兄弟，比如2012年的《风云市长》（Boss)。在我看，不管是剧情、表演、台词，还是cast，House of Cards都还相当逊色，Kevin Spcey够卖力气，但还不能把这部戏带进经典。<br><br>

美国电视剧的爸爸是英国同名电视剧，它的爷爷是Michael Dobbs。Lord Michael Dobbs出生于1948年，是个传奇的人物，他做过文胆，做过英国保守党的“幕僚长”（chief of staff）,同时，他是非常著名的作家，著述颇丰。有评论家认为他继承了莎士比亚、司各特甚至托尔斯泰的衣钵。有志有为之士，该去拜拜山门，这里：http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dobbs。这个著名的爵士作家有个远亲，小他二岁，名字也叫做Michael Dobbs。这位小Dobbs可能知道“一山不容二虎”这句中国古训，出生于贝尔法斯特的他早年是记者，四海飘蓬，主攻共产党国家的新闻报道.<br><br>


英国《House of Cards》的美国“孙子”剧本，出自于美国剧本写作界当红炸子鸡Beau Willimon。这哥们1999年从哥伦比亚大学毕业，2003年取得该校硕士学位。他热衷于政治，给一些政客（包括鼎鼎大名的希拉里・克林顿）打过零工，做过他们的义工或竞选助理。2007年他自己成了头条新闻，因为他的剧本同时被百老汇和好莱坞看中。根据剧本改编的电影，就是乔治・克鲁尼导演的《总统杀局》（The Ides of March）。<br><br>

宫斗片是另类鸡汤，很多观众期望能从中吸收营养，变得聪明，变得成熟，变得智慧，并免除或减少伤害。这，对个别人不是不可能，但也不尽现实，对多数人不是可能，但也不乏安慰。这都不是问题，以为自己站在舞台上才是问题。<br><br>

##如此说来，《House of Cards》体现了我们的领导不但没有品味，而且缺乏见识。几年前，下届常委曾推荐新书《论语别裁》。果真文革组无人可用也？我不知道...##<br><br>

Michael Dobbs was born on 14 November 1948 in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, the son of nurseryman Eric and Eileen Dobbs. He was educated at Hertford Grammar School and Christ Church, Oxford University. After graduating in 1971 he moved to the United States. He attended the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, funded by a job as feature writer for the Boston Globe, and graduated in 1975 with an M.A., M.A.L.D., and PhD in nuclear defence studies. His doctoral thesis was published as SALT on the Dragon's Tail. He worked on The Boston Globe as an editorial assistant and political feature writer from 1971 to 1975. In 2007, Dobbs gave the Alumni Salutation at Tufts.<br><br>

Politics <br><br>

After getting his PhD in 1975, Dobbs returned to England and began working in London for the Conservative Party. He was an advisor to Margaret Thatcher, who was then leader of the Opposition, from 1977 to 1979. From 1979 to 1981 he was a Conservative MP speechwriter. He served as a Government Special Advisor from 1981 to 1986. He was the Conservative Party Chief of Staff from 1986 to 1987. He survived the Brighton Bombing in 1984 at the Conservative Party Conference. Considered a masterful political operator, he was called "Westminster’s baby-faced hit man", by The Guardian in 1987. In the John Major government, he served as Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party from 1994 to 1995.<br><br>

Dobbs was created a life peer on 18 December 2010, as Baron Dobbs of Wylye, in the County of Wiltshire, and was introduced to the House of Lords on 20 December.[1] He sits as a Conservative Peer.[2]<br><br>

Business activities<br><br>

Dobbs began working at Saatchi & Saatchi as Deputy Advertising Chairman from 1983 to 1986. He was Director of Worldwide Corporate Communications from 1987 to 1988. He was Deputy Chairman, working directly under Maurice Saatchi from 1988 to 1991. From 1991 to 1998, he was a columnist for The Mail on Sunday. From 1998 to 2001, he hosted the current affairs program Despatch Box on BBC.<br><br>

Writing career<br><br>

Michael Dobbs' writing career began in 1989 with the publication of House of Cards, the first in what would become a trilogy of political thrillers with Francis Urquhart as the central character. House of Cards was followed by To Play the King in 1992 and The Final Cut in 1994. Each novel was adapted by BBC into a miniseries. The trilogy received 14 BAFTA nominations and two BAFTA wins and was voted the 84th Best British Show in History.[3] Netflix made a series based upon Dobbs's first novel and its BBC adaptation.<br><br>

His 2004 novel Winston's War was shortlisted for the Channel 4 Political Book of the Year Award and is in development to be adapted as a feature film. He has been a judge of the Whitbread Book of the Year Award and lectures at dozens of literary and fundraising events each year. His novels are also published in the United States.<br><br>

Anthony Howard of The Times said "Dobbs is following in a respectable tradition. Shakespeare, Walter Scott, even Tolstoy, all used historical events as the framework for their writings. And, unlike some of their distinguished works, Dobbs's novel is, in fact, astonishingly historically accurate".<br><br>

Dobbs is now a full-time writer, and divides his time between London and Wiltshire. He has two sons from his first marriage and two step-sons with his second wife, Rachel.<br><br>

It is the dawn of World War II, and Neville Chamberlain believes he has bought "peace for our time" from Adolph Hitler, who has just seized Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland. The English are alarmed by the huge German army, while the soldiers that would defend London don't even have steel helmets. For many, compromise and appeasement seem to be England's best defense. But there are a few leaders who don't agree. Among them is Winston Churchill, who understands that the relentless march of fascism will be democracy's death knell. In October 1938, Churchill pleads his case in the press to the BBC's Guy Burgess. One of these two will become the most revered man of his time, and the other will be known as the greatest of traitors.

Winston's War: A Novel of Conspiracy  by Michael Dobbs<br><br>

平装: 579页<br><br>

Winston's War is a 2003 novel by Michael Dobbs that presents a fictional account of the struggle of Winston Churchill to combat the appeasement policies of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.<br><br>

Plot summary <br><br>

The story starts with Chamberlain’s 1938 triumphant return to 10 Downing Street, a public hero after the signing of the Munich Agreement with Adolf Hitler, declaring "peace in our time." The story ends with the fall of the Chamberlain Government, and the appointment of Churchill as Prime Minister.<br><br>

Churchill, relegated to the periphery of British politics by the late Thirties, lashes out against appeasement despite having almost no support from fellow parliamentarians or the British press. The novel includes many of the momentous historical personages of the day: Chamberlain, the ailing and pacifist Prime Minister; Churchill, the political outcast, whose pugnacity created opprobrium in the public eye; Joseph Kennedy, the U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James's; Guy Burgess, an alcoholic BBC journalist of later Cold War infamy; the machiavellian newspaper mogul, Max Aitken, (Lord Beaverbrook), and the stuttering and insecure King George VI, who personally detests Churchill and tries to persuade his good friend, Lord Halifax, to take the reins of leadership.<br><br>

Winston's War is the first in a series of novels by Dobbs about Churchill's wartime leadership. The sequel Never Surrender continues the storyline over the first few weeks of Churchill's premiership.<br><br>

Churchill's Triumph: A Novel of Betrayal by Michael Dobbs <br><br>
出版社: Sourcebooks Landmark (2008年3月1日)<br><br>
平装: 352页<br><br>
语种： 英语<br><br>
For eight days, beginning on Saturday, February 3, 1945, the most powerful men in the world Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met at the Black Sea Resort of Yalta, where in the most momentous conference of the century, they preceded to divide up Europe. This novel, told from Churchill's point of view, takes you behind the scenes and brings you into the minds and hearts of the big three leaders: the dominating and seemingly all-powerful Joseph Stalin, with the largest army, and the mission of expanding the Soviet Empire; an ailing and fragile Roosevelt, willing to make whatever compromises he felt he had to in order to bring Stalin and Russia into the final campaign against Japan; and Churchill, the least powerful of the three, but the most far-sighted, who could not count on Roosevelt as his ally, and could not tame the avaricious Russian bear, determined to gobble up the nations around and beyond it. Like a fly on the wall of history, the reader becomes a hidden witness to these monumental negotiations, witnessing negotiations that would betray the heroic struggle of millions who died and fought in the Great War. Meanwhile, a Polish count who has taken on the persona of a deceased soldier appears in Churchill's suite to reveal one of the great unknown secrets of that time: the Soviet's systematic execution of thousands of Polish officers at Katyn, the mass murder that the Russians eventually blamed on the Germans. His courageous defiance of the German army's occupation of his village, and his village's fate at the hands of the victorious Russian army, serve as a profoundly moving subplot to the larger story. Churchill's Triumph allows the reader to eavesdrop on the world's mostpowerful men, as they lie, cheat, and deceive each other as they struggle to reach agreement and secure their places in history. All the historical aspects of the story are accurate, down to the last detail, including the spice Stalin put in his vodka. A bestseller in England, Churchill's Triumph received widespread press coverage and reviews: "His portrait of Churchill is as masterly as ever: a wonderful compound of bluster, sentimentality, grumpiness and indefatigable physical energy. There are the usual elegant metaphors... In the tragedy of Poland burning while statesmen fiddled, Dobbs has found a theme worthy of his powers."--Sunday Telegraph<br><br>

Churchill's Triumph<br><br>
A Novel of Betrayal<br><br>

ForeWord Review<br><br>

Perhaps God could create the world in His image in only six days; it took slightly longer for three mortal men to totally remake it in theirs.<br><br>

The three were the most powerful leaders in the world―Franklin Roosevelt, Josef Stalin and Winston Churchill―and they met at Yalta on the Black Sea during the closing months of World War II to decide the fate of the world, especially Germany and the country which had suffered the most during Hitler’s mad gambit at global domination, Poland. For eight days they conferred as supposed equals and allies, as the representatives of the victorious United States, the Soviet Union, and the British Empire. But Churchill sensed England’s empire was nearing its end, and as he argued to enlist Stalin’s support in the fight against Japan, it became utterly clear that the free world would soon face a new nemesis, one perhaps even worse than the Axis; for the Russian Bear sought to occupy the European power vacuum brought about by the looming defeat of Hitler.<br><br>

This historical novel is so well-written that the reader can easily forget that the crisp dialogue, verbal haranguing, and mental jousting between Churchill and Stalin for Roosevelt’s support are not verbatim transcripts of the actual events. For example, early in the conference, Churchill learns that far more than the fate of Germany is at stake:<br><br>

Stalin picked up his empty pipe and sucked thoughtfully. “How long will American troops stay in Europe after the war is over, Mr. President?” asked Stalin softly.<br><br>

“Two years would be the limit,” said Franklin.<br><br>

Then Stalin turned toward Churchill. There were no words. All he had to say was contained in his yellow eyes, and in the small smile he was unable to resist.<br><br>

"Two years. Two years! Inside, Churchill was screaming like a condemned man who had just seen the executioner sharpening his axe. Poland obliterated. Germany in ashes. France prostrate. Britain destitute. And America gone. Nothing would stand between the Kremlin and the Atlantic coast ― nothing, that was, but honor, and humanity, and any agreement they might reach at this conference."<br><br>

And what Stalin knew of honor or humanity could be crammed into the bowl of his pipe.<br><br>

Churchill’s hopes of staving off Stalin’s brutal plans for Eastern Europe by allying with Roosevelt at the conference were bitterly crushed. The American President’s precipitously declining health and idealistic hopes of forming the United Nations bent him to Stalin’s iron will and clever gamesmanship. Stalin cared not a whit for Roosevelt’s U.N. dream, but he used its importance to the American president to wrangle numerous concessions concerning the war-torn eastern European countries. When a disguised Polish nobleman appears at Churchill’s suite to recount the horrific tale of the Soviet massacre of thousands of Polish officers at Katyn, the mass murder that the Russians eventually blamed on the Germans, Churchill swears he will not allow the Bear to devour helpless Poland.<br><br>

As the events of the historic eight days unfold, however, Churchill finds that he must choose between making a deal with the Devil to help end the horrific war or keeping his word―and his soul―intact. His anguish as he grapples with his decision is almost palpable and makes for enthralling reading.<br><br>

The author knows his subject intimately. His publications include another Winston Churchill novel, Never Surrender, which recounts the beginning of World War II and Churchill’s steadfast determination during England’s bleak prospects against the Nazi onslaught. He paints a portrait of Churchill as a complex and riveting individual―a famously strident and blustery orator, a grumpy but sentimental statesman, and a father who could somehow overlook a Soviet diplomat’s attempted sexual assault on his daughter for the greater good of the conference, and the world.<br><br>

Of course, with the hindsight of history, the reader knows that Stalin will ultimately gain the upper hand at Yalta and will then raise an Iron Curtain across a divided Germany and Eastern Europe. Still, revisiting the events from Churchill’s perspective is compelling. Especially intriguing are Churchill’s feelings of betrayal by Roosevelt, the man he credited as the savior of England and whom he truly thought of as a friend. For Churchill understood that his place in history would be defined at Yalta, and the taste of defeat was bitter on his lips even as he raised his glass to toast Marshall Stalin and raised his pen to sign the final accord.<br><br>

This exceedingly well-crafted book will appeal to the history buff, the World War II aficionado and to the lover of great fiction alike. Despite the darkness that descended across Europe under Stalin, Churchill believed his Yalta gambit was the right course of action. The reader is left to decide whether, in the end, Yalta was truly Churchill’s triumph after all.<br><br>
