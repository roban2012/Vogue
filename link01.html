Vladimir Putin gives state-of-nation address to Federal Assembly<br><br>
12 December 2013, 12:15 <br><br>



Russia's President Vladimir Putin made the annual address to the Federal Assembly at noon, local time (8 am GMT). It is a double anniversary address: the 20th in Russia's recent history and the 10th made by Putin.<br><br>



 
Foreign Policy<br><br>

Russia seeks to be a world leader but no super-power aspirations - Putin<br><br>

Russia will be a leader but will not lecture other states on how they should live, President Vladimir Putin said. "We will aspire to be a leader by protecting international law and insisting upon respect for national sovereignty, independence and uniqueness of peoples," Putin said in his address presented at the Federal Assembly on Thursday.<br><br>

- Expanding missile defense, non-nuke high-precision systems may nullify strategic nuclear arms limitations - Putin<br><br>

"We have always been proud of our country, yet we do not aspire to super-power status, which is understood as a claim to global or regional hegemony. We are not encroaching on anyone's interests, we are not pushing our patronage on anyone and we are not trying to lecture anyone on how they should live," he stressed.<br><br>

Western missile defense system is defensive only in name - Putin<br><br>

The true goals of the missile defense system being built by Western countries do not correspond with its name, Russian President Vladimir Putin said.<br><br>

"We are perfectly aware that missile defense systems are defensive only in name. In fact, this is a significant component of a strategic offensive potential," Putin said in an annual address to the Federal Assembly on Thursday.
<br><br>
Syria<br><br>

Russia's Syria policies were "well-judged and reasonable" - Putin
<br><br>
Russia's steps intended to help settle the Syrian conflict have been "well-judged and reasonable", and the latest developments surrounding Syria confirm the possibility of resolving any international problems peacefully, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in his annual address to the Federal Assembly on Thursday.
<br><br>
"In my opinion, it is our shared success that the choice was made on the basis of the fundamental principles of international law, common sense and the logic of peace. At least thus far we have managed to avoid foreign military intervention in Syrian affairs and the spread of the conflict beyond the region," Putin said.
<br><br>
Russia "made quite a significant contribution to this process," the president said.
<br><br>
"Our actions have been resolute, well-judged and reasonable. Not a single time have we put either our own interests and security or global security in danger. In my opinion, this is the way a mature and responsible power should act," Putin said.<br><br>
"As a result, we and our partners managed to turn the situation there away from war and toward the development of a nationwide Syrian political process and the achievement of civil reconciliation," the president said.
<br><br>
"The Syrian precedent reaffirmed the UN's central role in global politics. As the situation around Syria and around Iran today has shown, any international problem can and should be resolved exclusively by peaceful means, without resorting to military actions, which have no prospects, but only serve to cause denunciation by the majority of countries in the world," Putin said.<br><br>

Iranian nuclear issue<br><br>

Putin suggests settling Iranian nuclear issues to guarantee security of all countries, including Israel.
<br><br>
- Putin urges peaceful atomic energy guarantee for Iran, security guarantee for Israel
<br><br>
Ukrainian issue<br><br>

Russia does not dictate anything to others, but is prepared to push ahead with integration projects with Ukraine if Kiev agrees.<br><br>

Constitution
<br><br>
The Constitutional framework should be stable, and amendments are only needed in order to overcome legal uncertainty, as for example in merging the Supreme Court and the Supreme Arbitration Court, Russian President Vladimir Putin said.
<br><br>
"I'm confident that the Constitutional framework should be stable; in the first place it concerns Chapter 2 of the Constitution on the rights and freedoms of person and citizen," Putin said. "These provisions are inviolable."
<br><br>
"But life does not stand still, and the Constitutional process cannot be viewed as fully completed," the Russian leader underlined. "Fine adjustments required by life itself are possible and sometimes necessary."
<br><br>
As an example, Putin recalled the proposal to merge the Supreme Court and the Supreme Arbitration Court. "Their interpretations of law sometimes differ today. This results in legal uncertainty," the president said. In his view, the merger of the two courts will put judicial practice on one course.
<br><br>
- Putin suggests drafting public control law
<br><br>
- Putin urges Duma to adopt laws on independent assessment of social institutions
<br><br>
- Unification of Supreme Court, Higher Arbitration Court should help ensure equality before law - Putin
<br><br>
Political competition
<br><br>
Russia's president spoke for development of political competition in the country and for wide public discussion on key issues.
<br><br>
"I believe it is important that many new parties have asserted themselves, wining seats in municipal and regional bodies of authority, they have laid a good foundation for participation in future election campaigns. I am sure that they will be worthy competitors to the political old-timers," the president said.
<br><br>
Economy
<br><br>
Main reasons for Russian economic slowdown internal - Putin
<br><br>
The main causes of the Russia's slowdown in economic growth are internal, President Vladimir Putin told the Federal Assembly.
<br><br>
"Yes, of course we are feeling the consequences of the global crisis. But we have to be frank and say the main reasons for the slowdown are not external but internal," he said.
<br><br>
Economic trends, lack of funds not reason to revise May 2012 presidential decrees - Putin
<br><br>
The ambitious goals of Russia's socioeconomic development set in the May 2012 presidential decrees will not be revised due to economic difficulties, Russian President Vladimir Putin said.
<br><br>
"I hear from time to time that there is not enough money for the implementation of all these declared plans and goals, and that it is necessary to lower our standards and to simplify our tasks. I believe politics should not be based on formal principles," Putin said in an annual address to the Federal Assembly on Thursday.
<br><br>
"Surely, economic trends may vary but this is no reason to talk about revising our goals," Putin said. "We should do real work, look for solutions and clearly set budgets and other priorities," Putin said.
<br><br>
- Putin demands that each manager's responsibility for work results be increased
<br><br>
Ethnic issues
<br><br>
Multi-national peace needs to be preserved and protected against immoral people who have no respect for tradition, either their own or foreign, Putin said.
<br><br>
"Inter-ethnic tension is provoked not by representatives of some peoples but people who have no culture, respect for the traditions, neither their own not those of the others. This is some kind of amoral international trend, which includes reckless and impudent natives of several southern regions, corrupt law enforcers, who give cover to ethnic criminal groups and the so-called Russian nationalists, the so-called separatists, who are prepared to take any tragedy as an excuse for vandalism and a blood bath," the Russian leader stated.

<br><br>
- Migration law offenders to be barred from entering Russia for 3-10 years - Putin
<br><br>
Volunteers
<br><br>
Putin proposed organizing a volunteer movement to assist with medical care
<br><br>
Human rights
<br><br>
Russia's President Vladimir Putin proposed broad discussion on public control law. He also proposed promoting human rights movements in the country.
<br><br>
"Today's Russia stands in need of a broad public discussion, one that brings about practical results, a discussion that turns public initiatives into state policies," he said in the annual State of the Nation Address to both houses of the Russian parliament, "Society should control their execution."
<br><br>
"I think all the bills, key state decisions and strategic plans should pass the so-called 'zero reading' in which nongovernmental organizations and other institutes of civic society will take place," Putin said.
<br><br>
- Pinpointed adjustments of constitution possible, human rights provisions unwavering - Putin
<br><br>
Demographics and housing
<br><br>
In January-October of the current year, Russia recorded natural population growth for the first time since 1991, Russia's President said.
<br><br>
The president is sure the trend may be addressed by, among others, a program of housing construction. Putin suggested calling it "Housing for Russian the Family".
<br><br>
Along with this, he admitted that "slow rates of housing construction development are explained by heavy corruption in the sphere".
<br><br>
- Migration law offenders to be barred from entering Russia for 3-10 years - Putin
<br><br>
Diversification
<br><br>
Russia's President Vladimir Putin is dissatisfied with the fact that an effective system to support non-raw-material export has not begun, and demands from the government and the Agency of Strategic Investments to offer by March 1, 2014 a new roadmap on development of the export market.
<br><br>
"A system of that kind has not begun working. Many administrative barriers still exist. An export license processing takes over 20 days. Compare with six days in the US, eight in Canada or South Korea. All these aspects should be considered in a new roadmap on supporting exports," the president said.
<br><br>
"I am addressing the government and the Agency of Strategic Investments to offer it by Marc h 1, 2014," he said.
<br><br>
Taxation
<br><br>
Vladimir Putin said that offshore zones still have to be taxed under Russian law.

<br><br>
Vladimir Putin to address Federal Assembly, give key highlights on Russia's economy, society, upcoming amnesty
<br><br>
Russian President Vladimir Putin will deliver his annual address to the Federal Assembly at noon on Thursday, December 12, the day the Russian Constitution was adopted 20 years ago. This will be the president's 10th address to the Federal Assembly, the Russian parliament that consists of two chambers: the State Duma, the lower one, and the Federation Council, the upper one. Russia's current economic and social problems, the mass amnesty due to the 20th anniversary of the Russian Constitution and proposals made at a forum of the Russian People's Front in Moscow in December are expected to be the topics of Vladimir Putin's speech.
<br><br>
The presidential address is usually prepared behind closed doors. Media reported that the president's speech may address possible Constitutional amendments; however, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov refuted the reports.
<br><br>
"Media reports that the issue is about changing the Constitution are not correct. One should just recall recent multiple statements about this issue by the president, the guarantor of the Constitution, who said that the Constitution is not a law that may be changed and cut to the truckle of the current political situation," Peskov said earlier.
<br><br>
Less than a month before the address Putin said that it will outline not only tasks for the next year but also strategic goals.
<br><br>
"This [the address] is not a purely formal act, although it is stipulated by the law, but it is an event that formulates our common work at least for the next year, and even more far-reaching goals may be set in the political, economic, and social sector," Putin said.
<br><br>
Preparing the address the president had traditional meeting with the leaders of parliamentary parties. He also met the leaders of small parties that have no seats on the State Duma.
<br><br>
It is expected that the address may voice proposals made at a forum of the Russian People's Front in Moscow in December.
<br><br>
Just a day before the address Putin discussed its preparations with members of the Russian Security Council.
<br><br>
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Presidential Administration Head Sergei Ivanov, State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin, Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev, Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Federal Security Service Director Alexander Bortnikov, Foreign Intelligence Service Head Mikhail Fradkov and Russian Security Council permanent member Boris Gryzlov attended the meeting.

<br><br>


Putin will deliver the address in the Georgievsky Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace to approximately 1,100 people invited at noon on December 12.
